## Mi viaje más reciente con mis padres
Nunca había viajado con mis padres solo por diversión. No fue sino hasta junio de 2025 que decidimos hacer un viaje juntos.

Fue difícil convencerlos porque ellos no viajan muy a menudo. Al principio se negaron, pero luego de múltiples intentos de convencerlos y de mantener una posición firme, accedieron a viajar a Bogotá, la ciudad donde actualmente vivo.

El viaje es largo: 8 horas en bus. Viajaron de noche y llegaron a la terminal a las 9 a.m., día en el que fui a recogerlos.

Ese día en la terminal me pasó algo curioso. Fue difícil encontrar la posición en la que estaban, por lo que vagué mucho por toda la terminal, hasta que una agente de policía me detuvo para verificar mi identificación. En ese momento llevaba una maleta con un libro de inteligencia artificial. A la agente le pareció curioso y me dejó continuar luego de verificar mi número de cédula en el sistema de la policía.

## My most recent trip with my parents
I had never traveled with my parents just for fun. It wasn’t until June 2025 that we decided to take a trip together.

It was difficult to convince them because they don’t usually travel. At first, they refused, but after many attempts to persuade them and standing my ground, they agreed to travel to Bogotá, which is the city I currently live in.

The trip is long—about 8 hours by bus. They traveled overnight and arrived at the terminal at 9 a.m., and I went to pick them up.

That day at the terminal, something curious happened to me. It was difficult to find where my parents were, so I wandered around the entire terminal. A police officer stopped me to check my identification, apparently because I looked suspicious. At the time, I was carrying a bag with a book on artificial intelligence. The officer found it interesting and let me go after checking my ID number in their system.



Explicaciones:

“No fue si no” → “No fue sino”: es una sola palabra en este contexto adversativo.

“posiion” → “posición”: error tipográfico.

“arrivaron” → “llegaron”: "arrivar" existe pero es poco común; "llegar" es más natural.

“me paso algo curioso” → “me pasó algo curioso”: faltaba tilde.

“divague” → “vagué”: "divagar" implica hablar sin rumbo, “vagar” implica moverse sin rumbo, que es lo que describes.

“llevava” → “llevaba”

“le parecio” → “le pareció”

Bogota is the city where i live [⛔ Capitalize I. Better style: which is the city I currently live in].
