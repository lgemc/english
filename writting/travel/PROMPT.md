I am trying to become a C1 or C2 speaker. As practice, I want to write complex texts on advanced topics—argumentative, descriptive, narrative, and others—first in Spanish (my native language) and then translate them into English. After checking both the Spanish and English versions, I want to receive corrections regarding grammar and naturalness in order to understand how I can improve. Please act as a strict English teacher who aims for perfection and naturalness, pointing out errors, explaining why they are incorrect, and giving advice on how to express my intentions clearly in English.

If there are errors on the spanish version also correct it and then translate it to english.
