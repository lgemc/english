# 7. Practice Strategies and Test-Taking Skills

**Chapter summary:** Advanced techniques for maximizing GRE Verbal scores, including adaptive testing strategies, stress management, and comprehensive review methods.

## Computer-Adaptive Testing (CAT) Strategies

**How GRE Adapts:**
- Section-level adaptation (not question-level)
- First Verbal section is medium difficulty
- Second section difficulty depends on first section performance:
  - Perform well → harder second section → higher score potential
  - Perform poorly → easier second section → lower score ceiling

**Strategic Implications:**

**1. First Section Matters Most:**
- Determines difficulty of second section
- Affects score range possible in second section
- Take time to answer carefully
- Don't rush through first section

**2. Second Section Strategy:**
- If it feels hard, you're doing well (first section went well)
- If it feels easy, you didn't do well on first section
- Don't panic if second section seems difficult—it's good news
- Stay focused regardless of perceived difficulty

**3. Every Question Counts:**
- Unlike some adaptive tests, later questions aren't worth more
- All questions weighted equally within a section
- Don't sacrifice accuracy for speed
- Can't skip and return within same question set (but can review marked questions)

**4. Time Management:**
- Pace yourself evenly
- Don't spend too long on any one question
- Mark difficult questions and return if time permits
- Last 5 questions shouldn't be random guesses

**5. No Penalty for Guessing:**
- Never leave blanks
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Make educated guess if needed
- Random guess better than blank

## Process of Elimination Techniques

**Reading Comprehension:**

**Eliminate if answer:**
- Uses extreme language (always, never, only, must) without passage support
- Contains information not mentioned in passage
- Contradicts passage information
- Is too narrow (focuses on detail when question asks for main idea)
- Is too broad (general topic when question asks for specific point)
- Confuses cause and effect
- Reverses passage meaning

**Text Completion:**

**Eliminate if word:**
- Doesn't fit grammatically
- Creates illogical meaning
- Ignores signal words (contrast, continuation)
- Contradicts earlier part of sentence
- Is opposite of required meaning

**For Double/Triple Blank:**
- Eliminate choices for each blank independently
- Cross out impossible combinations
- Test remaining combinations together

**Sentence Equivalence:**

**Eliminate if:**
- Only one word of a synonym pair fits context
- Word fits but has no synonym among choices
- Two synonyms don't create equivalent meanings

**Strategy:**
1. Predict meaning
2. Find two words closest to prediction
3. Verify they're synonyms
4. Test both in sentence
5. Confirm equivalent meanings

**General Elimination Tips:**
- Cross out eliminated choices (use scratch paper)
- If stuck between two, choose and move on
- Trust your first instinct unless you find clear error
- Eliminate clearly wrong answers first
- Be suspicious of choices that repeat passage words without matching meaning

## Educated Guessing When Necessary

**When to Guess:**
- After spending appropriate time (1.5-2 minutes)
- When you've eliminated some choices
- When running low on time

**How to Guess Effectively:**

**1. Use Partial Knowledge:**
- Recognize some words in text completion
- Understand parts of passage even if not whole
- Know one blank in multi-blank question

**2. Vocabulary Strategies:**
- Use word roots, prefixes, suffixes
- Consider positive vs negative connotation
- Think of related words you know
- Eliminate words you know don't fit

**3. Reading Comprehension:**
- Eliminate extreme answers
- Choose more moderate options
- Favor answers paraphrasing passage language
- Avoid answers requiring outside knowledge

**4. Logic and Intuition:**
- Choose answer that "sounds right"
- Consider question type norms
- Be wary of trick answers (too obvious)

**5. Pattern Awareness:**
- For sentence equivalence, pair must be synonyms
- Main idea is not too specific, not too broad
- Function questions: why author included something

**Final Guessing (when time is short):**
- Don't leave blanks
- Make quick elimination if possible
- Select and move on
- Don't agonize

## Managing Test Anxiety

**Before Test Day:**

**Preparation Reduces Anxiety:**
- Take full-length practice tests under timed conditions
- Familiarize yourself with test format and interface
- Build confidence through adequate preparation
- Identify and work on weak areas

**Physical Preparation:**
- Get adequate sleep (especially week before)
- Exercise regularly
- Eat nutritious meals
- Avoid cramming night before
- Prepare materials night before (ID, confirmation, snacks)

**Mental Preparation:**
- Visualize success
- Practice relaxation techniques
- Develop positive self-talk
- Accept some nervousness is normal
- Remember: test is one factor among many in applications

**During Test:**

**Physical Techniques:**
- Deep breathing (4 counts in, hold 4, exhale 4)
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Stretch during breaks
- Stay hydrated
- Eat snack during break

**Mental Techniques:**
- Focus on one question at a time

**Perspective:**
- One bad question doesn't ruin score
- Can't tell how you're doing while testing
- Difficult section might mean higher scoring level
- Can retake if necessary
- Many successful applicants have varied scores

## Creating an Effective Study Schedule

**Assessment Phase (Week 1):**

- Confused question types

**Solution:** Read more carefully; circle key words

**3. Time Pressure:**
- Rushed and made careless error
- Didn't read all choices
- Made computational mistake

**Solution:** Improve pacing; practice time management

**4. Strategic Error:**
- Used wrong approach
- Didn't eliminate choices
- Didn't use process of elimination

**Solution:** Review and practice correct strategy

**5. Overthinking:**
- Changed correct answer
- Read too much into question
- Made unwarranted assumptions

**Solution:** Trust preparation; avoid overanalysis

**Error Log:**
Create spreadsheet or notebook:
- Question number/source
- Error category
- Correct answer and why
- Your wrong answer and why you chose it
- Lesson learned
- Similar question to try later

**Review Schedule:**
- Immediate: Review right after practice
- Short-term: Review errors after 2-3 days
- Long-term: Review all errors weekly
- Pre-test: Review error log before test

**Patterns to Notice:**
- Consistent issues with certain question types
- Recurring vocabulary words you don't know
- Same types of logical errors
