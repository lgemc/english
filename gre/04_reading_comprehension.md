# 4. Reading Comprehension Mastery

**Chapter summary:** Comprehensive strategies for tackling GRE reading passages, including short and long passages across humanities, sciences, and social sciences.

## Active Reading Techniques

**Before Reading:**
- Note passage length and question count
- Scan questions quickly to identify topics (don't read in detail)
- Decide reading strategy based on passage type

**During Reading:**
- Read with purpose—look for main idea and structure
- Mark topic sentences (usually first sentence of paragraphs)
- Note transitions and signal words (however, furthermore, in contrast)
- Circle key terms and unfamiliar words
- Identify author's tone and attitude
- Don't get bogged down in details—you can return later

**Annotation Techniques:**
- Underline main idea
- Circle contrasting viewpoints
- Mark examples with "ex"
- Note conclusions with arrows →
- Use brackets for definitions or clarifications
- Number arguments (1, 2, 3)

**Reading Speed:**
- Short passages (1 paragraph): read thoroughly
- Long passages (3-5 paragraphs): focus on structure, skim details
- Science passages: don't try to understand everything—focus on overall point

## Identifying Main Ideas and Primary Purpose

**Main Idea:**
- Central point the author wants to convey
- Often stated in introduction or conclusion
- Not too specific (that's a detail)
- Not too broad (that's a topic)

**Where to Find:**
- First paragraph (especially last sentence)
- Last paragraph (especially first sentence)
- Topic sentences of body paragraphs

**Common Wrong Answers:**
- Too specific: focuses on one paragraph or example
- Too broad: covers the general topic but not the passage's focus
- Outside scope: introduces ideas not in passage
- Reverses relationship: switches cause/effect or opposing views

**Primary Purpose Questions:**
- What is author trying to accomplish?
- Common purposes:
  - Present a theory and provide evidence
  - Compare and contrast two views
  - Describe a phenomenon and explain its causes
  - Critique an argument or assumption
  - Propose a solution to a problem
  - Trace historical development

**Question Stems:**
- "The primary purpose of the passage is to..."
- "The author is primarily concerned with..."
- "Which of the following best describes the passage?"

**Answer Format:**
- Usually begins with verb: "to argue," "to describe," "to challenge"
- Should match passage structure and tone
- Avoid answers that describe only part of passage

## Making Inferences and Drawing Conclusions

**Inference Questions:**
- Answer must be true based on passage
- Not explicitly stated
- Should follow logically from given information
- Avoid extreme extrapolation

**Valid Inference:**
- Direct logical consequence of passage statements
- Combines information from multiple sentences
- Paraphrases passage ideas

**Invalid Inference:**
- Requires outside knowledge
- Too extreme (uses "always," "never," "only" without support)
- Goes beyond what passage implies
- Contradicts passage information

**Question Stems:**
- "It can be inferred from the passage that..."
- "The passage suggests that..."
- "The author implies that..."
- "Which of the following can be concluded..."

**Strategy:**
- Identify relevant passage section
- Read carefully what is stated
- Consider what must be true based on that
- Eliminate answers that are: too extreme, contradicted, irrelevant, outside scope
- Choose answer with strongest textual support

**Common Inference Types:**
- Author's opinion (based on tone and word choice)
- Logical consequence (if X is true, Y must follow)
- Cause-effect relationship (what led to what)
- Comparison (how things relate)

## Understanding Tone, Style, and Author's Attitude

**Tone Words:**

**Positive:**
- optimistic, enthusiastic, supportive, appreciative, admiring, respectful

**Negative:**
- critical, skeptical, dismissive, contemptuous, scornful, pessimistic, cynical

**Neutral/Analytical:**
- objective, detached, analytical, descriptive, informative, explanatory

**Nuanced:**
- ambivalent (mixed feelings)
- ironic (saying opposite of what's meant)
- cautiously optimistic
- qualified approval/criticism
- guarded enthusiasm

**Finding Author's Tone:**
- Word choice (positive/negative connotations)
- Descriptive adjectives
- Strength of claims (definitive vs hedging)
- Treatment of opposing views
- Use of examples

**Signal Phrases:**
- "Unfortunately..." (negative)
- "Notably..." (emphasis)
- "Surprisingly..." (unexpected)
- "Merely..." (dismissive)
- "Remarkably..." (admiration)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Choosing extreme tone (GRE favors moderate tones)
- Confusing subject matter with tone (passage about war ≠ negative tone)
- Ignoring qualifiers ("somewhat critical" vs "highly critical")

## Handling Detail and Specific Information Questions

**Types:**
- According to the passage...
- The author mentions X in order to...
- Which of the following is cited as...

**Strategy:**
- Identify key words in question
- Locate relevant passage section (line reference or key term)
- Read context (sentence before and after)
- Match passage language to answer (often paraphrased)
- Eliminate answers based on: wrong detail, right detail but wrong question, not mentioned

**Function Questions:**
"The author mentions X in order to..."
- Determine role in passage structure
- Common functions:
  - Provide example of concept
  - Support main argument
  - Introduce contrasting view
  - Illustrate a problem
  - Lead to conclusion

**EXCEPT/LEAST Questions:**
- All answers but one are in passage
- Eliminate four answers that ARE mentioned
- Remaining answer is correct
- Time-consuming—often skip and return

## Analyzing Arguments and Logical Structure

**Argument Structure:**
1. **Claim/Conclusion**: What author argues
2. **Evidence**: Facts, data, examples supporting claim
3. **Assumptions**: Unstated beliefs connecting evidence to claim
4. **Counterarguments**: Opposing views (often acknowledged and refuted)

**Signal Words for Arguments:**
- Conclusion indicators: therefore, thus, consequently, hence, suggests that
- Evidence indicators: because, since, given that, for example
- Contrast: however, although, despite, on the other hand
- Continuation: moreover, furthermore, additionally

**Common Logical Patterns:**
- Cause and Effect: X causes Y
- Comparison: X is similar to/different from Y
- Classification: X is a type of Y
- Problem-Solution: X is a problem, Y is solution
- Chronological: events in time order

**Evaluating Arguments:**
- Is evidence relevant?
- Is evidence sufficient?
- Are there unstated assumptions?
- Are there alternative explanations?
- Are there logical fallacies?

**Common Fallacies on GRE:**
- Hasty generalization: concluding from insufficient evidence
- False cause: assuming correlation implies causation
- Appeal to authority: citing expert without relevant expertise
- Circular reasoning: using conclusion to support itself
- False dichotomy: presenting only two options when more exist

## Comparative Reading Passages

**Format:**
- Two related short passages (Passage 1 and Passage 2)
- 1-2 paragraphs each
- Questions about each individually and their relationship

**Question Types:**
1. About Passage 1 only
2. About Passage 2 only
3. Comparing/contrasting both passages
4. How authors would respond to each other

**Strategy:**
- Read Passage 1, answer its questions
- Read Passage 2, note relationship to Passage 1
- Answer comparison questions
- Common relationships:
  - Agreement with different evidence
  - Direct disagreement
  - Different aspects of same topic
  - General principle vs specific application

**Comparison Question Stems:**
- "Both passages are primarily concerned with..."
- "The authors of both passages would agree that..."
- "Passage 2 differs from Passage 1 in that..."
- "How would the author of Passage 2 respond to [claim in Passage 1]?"

**Key Points:**
- Identify each author's main claim
- Note areas of agreement and disagreement
- Consider different emphases or perspectives
- Avoid confusing which passage said what

## Science and Technical Passage Strategies

**Challenges:**
- Unfamiliar terminology
- Complex concepts
- Dense information
- Specialized knowledge

**Strategies:**

**1. Don't Panic:**
- You don't need to fully understand the science
- Questions test reading comprehension, not science knowledge
- Focus on structure and main points

**2. Identify Key Elements:**
- What is being studied? (subject)
- What did researchers find? (findings)
- Why is it significant? (implications)
- Are there competing theories? (if mentioned)

**3. Handle Technical Terms:**
- Often defined in context—use those definitions
- If not defined, focus on function in argument
- Don't waste time trying to pronounce mentally
- Use abbreviations (e.g., "ATP" instead of reading out each time)

**4. Track Relationships:**
- What causes what?
- What is compared to what?
- What supports or challenges what?

**5. Use Process of Elimination:**
- Science passages often have detail questions
- Wrong answers may:
  - Confuse which factor affects which
  - Reverse cause-effect
  - Contradict passage facts
  - Go beyond passage scope

**Common Science Passage Structures:**
- Describe phenomenon, explain mechanism
- Present problem, discuss research, state findings
- Introduce theory, present evidence, discuss implications
- Compare old and new understanding

**Sample Topics:**
- Biology: evolutionary adaptations, cellular processes, ecology
- Physics: particle behavior, physical properties, theories
- Astronomy: celestial phenomena, cosmological theories
- Geology: earth processes, formations, climate
- Psychology: cognitive processes, behavioral studies
- Archaeology/Anthropology: human development, cultural practices

**Tips:**
- Read introduction carefully—sets up topic
- Note study methods mentioned (how research was done)
- Pay attention to limitations or caveats mentioned
- Watch for author's evaluation (positive/negative/neutral)
- Conclusion often states significance or implications

**Example Structure:**
Paragraph 1: Background and what is known
Paragraph 2: New research or observation
Paragraph 3: Findings and their significance
Paragraph 4: Implications or future directions

**Focus Areas:**
- Main finding or discovery
- Why it matters (significance)
- How it relates to previous understanding (challenges, supports, modifies)
- Author's assessment of the research
