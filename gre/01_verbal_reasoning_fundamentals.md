# 1. GRE Verbal Reasoning Fundamentals

**Chapter summary:** Introduction to GRE Verbal section structure, question types, and essential strategies for text completion, sentence equivalence, and reading comprehension.

## GRE Verbal Section Overview

**Format:**
- Two 30-minute sections
- 20 questions per section (40 total)
- Computer-adaptive: difficulty adjusts based on performance

**Question Distribution:**
- Text Completion: ~6 questions per section
- Sentence Equivalence: ~4 questions per section
- Reading Comprehension: ~10 questions per section

**Scoring:** 130-170 scale (1-point increments)

**Key Skills Tested:**
- Vocabulary in context
- Analyzing complex texts
- Understanding logical relationships
- Identifying main ideas and details

## Text Completion Strategies (Single, Double, Triple Blank)

**Single-Blank:**
- Read entire sentence for context
- Predict word before looking at choices
- Look for signal words (but, although, because, therefore)
- Eliminate choices that don't fit context

**Double-Blank:**
- Determine which blank is easier first
- Consider each blank independently
- Check both words together in final answer
- Look for parallel structure or contrast

**Triple-Blank:**
- Work one blank at a time
- Start with blank that has clearest context clues
- Narrow options systematically
- Verify final combination makes logical sense

**Signal Words:**
- Continuation: and, furthermore, additionally, moreover
- Contrast: but, however, although, despite, yet, nevertheless
- Cause/Effect: because, therefore, thus, consequently, hence
- Emphasis: indeed, in fact, certainly

## Sentence Equivalence Techniques

**Goal:** Select TWO answers that:
1. Complete the sentence coherently
2. Produce sentences similar in meaning
3. Fit grammatically

**Strategy:**
- Read for overall meaning
- Predict a word that fits
- Find two synonyms from choices
- Verify both create equivalent meanings
- Don't just match synonyms—check context fit

**Common Patterns:**
- Direct synonyms: elusive/evasive, laconic/terse
- Near-synonyms in context: copious/abundant
- Words with similar connotations: arcane/esoteric

**Warning:** Avoid choosing:
- Two synonyms that don't fit the context
- Words that fit individually but create different meanings

## Reading Comprehension Question Types

**1. Main Idea/Primary Purpose:**
- Identify overall theme
- Focus on passage structure
- Eliminate overly specific or broad options

**2. Detail/Specific Information:**
- Locate relevant passage section
- Match passage language to answer
- Watch for paraphrasing

**3. Inference:**
- Based on passage evidence
- Must be supported but not explicitly stated
- Avoid extreme extrapolations

**4. Logical Structure:**
- How argument develops
- Relationship between paragraphs
- Function of specific sentences

**5. Tone/Attitude:**
- Author's perspective
- Positive, negative, neutral, or mixed
- Support with textual evidence

**6. Vocabulary in Context:**
- How word functions in passage
- May differ from common meaning
- Use surrounding context

**7. Strengthen/Weaken:**
- Which statement supports/undermines argument
- Consider assumptions and evidence

**8. Select-in-Passage:**
- Click sentence that meets criterion
- Scan for specific function or claim

**9. Multiple Answer:**
- Select all that apply
- Each choice evaluated independently
- Often 3 choices, any number correct

## Time Management and Pacing

**Per Section (30 minutes):**
- Text Completion: ~1-1.5 minutes each
- Sentence Equivalence: ~1 minute each
- Short Reading Passages (1 paragraph): ~1-2 minutes reading + 1 minute per question
- Long Reading Passages (2-5 paragraphs): ~3-4 minutes reading + 1-1.5 minutes per question

**Strategies:**
- Mark difficult questions and return later
- Don't get stuck on any single question
- Spend time on passages wisely—you'll answer multiple questions per passage
- Leave 2-3 minutes for review

**Pacing Tips:**
- Check time after every 10 questions
- If behind, move faster on text completion
- If ahead, double-check reading comprehension
- Use scratch paper for notes and tracking

## Common Traps and How to Avoid Them

**Vocabulary Traps:**
- Choosing a familiar word that doesn't fit context
- Selecting based on "sounds smart" rather than meaning
- Falling for partial synonyms

**Avoidance:** Always check context; predict before looking at choices

**Reading Comprehension Traps:**
- Choosing answers with passage words but wrong meaning
- Selecting based on outside knowledge
- Picking extreme or absolute statements
- Missing qualifiers (some, may, often vs all, must, always)

**Avoidance:** Base answers only on passage; be wary of absolutes; reread relevant sections

**Text Completion Traps:**
- Ignoring negative words (not, hardly, scarcely)
- Missing contrast or continuation signals
- Choosing synonyms without checking context

**Avoidance:** Circle signal words; verify logical flow

**Time Management Traps:**
- Spending too long on one difficult question
- Rushing through reading passages
- Not using mark/review feature

**Avoidance:** Set time checkpoints; practice pacing; know when to move on

**General Tips:**
- Read carefully but efficiently
- Use process of elimination
- Trust your preparation
- Stay calm and focused
