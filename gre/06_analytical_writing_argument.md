# 6. Analytical Writing: Argument Essay

**Chapter summary:** Mastering the Analyze an Argument task, identifying logical fallacies, evaluating evidence, and constructing well-reasoned critiques.

## Understanding the Argument Task

**Format:**
- 30 minutes
- Analyze someone else's argument
- Identify flaws, assumptions, and weaknesses
- Do NOT state whether you agree or disagree with the conclusion

**Your Task:**
- Critique the LOGIC and EVIDENCE
- Identify unstated ASSUMPTIONS
- Explain how argument could be strengthened
- Discuss what additional information would help evaluate it

**Key Difference from Issue Essay:**
- Issue: Develop YOUR argument
- Argument: Critique THEIR argument
- Issue: Take a position
- Argument: Analyze reasoning objectively

**What Scorers Look For:**
- Identification of key features of the argument
- Insightful analysis of reasoning
- Well-developed critique
- Logical organization
- Facility with language
- Control of standard written English

**Common Instructions:**
- "Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument."
- "Discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation."
- "Discuss what questions would need to be answered to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result."
- "Discuss what evidence is needed to evaluate the argument."

## Identifying Claims, Evidence, and Assumptions

**Anatomy of an Argument:**

**1. Conclusion (Main Claim):**
- What the author wants you to believe
- The recommendation or prediction
- Usually at beginning or end
- Signal words: therefore, thus, clearly, should, must

**2. Evidence (Premises):**
- Facts, statistics, examples, studies
- What author uses to support conclusion
- May be strong or weak, relevant or irrelevant

**3. Assumptions:**
- Unstated beliefs connecting evidence to conclusion
- What must be true for argument to work
- Often where arguments are weakest
- Bridge between evidence and conclusion

**Example:**

**Argument:** "A recent survey showed that 80% of Smithville residents want more parking downtown. Therefore, the city should build a parking garage."

**Conclusion:** City should build parking garage

**Evidence:** Survey showing 80% want more parking

**Assumptions:**
- Survey is representative and reliable
- More parking will satisfy the need
- Benefits outweigh costs
- Parking garage is best solution
- Residents will use garage once built
- No better uses for city funds

**How to Identify Assumptions:**
- Ask: "What must be true for this conclusion to follow?"
- Look for gaps between evidence and conclusion
- Consider alternative explanations
- Think about what's NOT mentioned

## Common Logical Fallacies on the GRE

**1. Hasty Generalization:**
- Concluding from insufficient or unrepresentative evidence
- Example: "Three customers complained, so our product is defective."
- Question: Is the sample representative? Is it large enough?

**2. False Cause (Post Hoc):**
- Assuming correlation implies causation
- Example: "Crime decreased after the new mayor took office, so their policies worked."
- Question: Could other factors explain the change? Is timing coincidental?

**3. Biased Sample:**
- Drawing conclusions from non-representative group
- Example: "Our online survey shows customers are satisfied." (Only motivated people respond)
- Question: Who was surveyed? Who was excluded?

**4. Circular Reasoning:**
- Using conclusion as evidence for itself
- Example: "This policy is good because it's beneficial."
- Question: What independent evidence supports this?

**5. False Analogy:**
- Assuming two things are similar when they differ in important ways
- Example: "This marketing strategy worked in City A, so it will work in City B."
- Question: Are the situations truly comparable?

**6. Appeal to Inappropriate Authority:**
- Citing someone without relevant expertise
- Example: "A famous actor endorses this diet, so it must be healthy."
- Question: Does this person have relevant credentials?

**7. False Dichotomy:**
- Presenting only two options when more exist
- Example: "Either we expand or we fail."
- Question: Are there other alternatives?

**8. Slippery Slope:**
- Assuming one event will inevitably lead to extreme consequences
- Example: "If we allow this small change, everything will collapse."
- Question: Is the chain of events inevitable?

**9. Ad Populum (Bandwagon):**
- Arguing something is right because it's popular
- Example: "Most people believe this, so it must be true."
- Question: Is popularity evidence of validity?

**10. Equivocation:**
- Using a word with different meanings in different parts of argument
- Example: Using "natural" to mean both "occurring in nature" and "healthy"

## Evaluating the Strength of Arguments

**Questions to Ask:**

**About Evidence:**
- Is it relevant to the conclusion?
- Is it sufficient?
- Is it recent/timely?
- Is the source reliable?
- Is it representative?
- Could it be interpreted differently?

**About Reasoning:**
- Does conclusion follow logically from evidence?
- What assumptions connect evidence to conclusion?
- Are there alternative explanations?
- What's been left out?
- Are comparisons appropriate?
- Are predictions realistic?

**About Recommendations:**
- Is the problem correctly identified?
- Will proposed solution address the problem?
- Are there negative consequences?
- Is it feasible/practical?
- Are there better alternatives?

**Red Flags in Arguments:**
- Vague or ambiguous terms
- Cherry-picked evidence
- Unrepresentative samples
- Assuming correlation is causation
- Ignoring alternative explanations
- Predictions without justification
- Missing relevant information

## Structuring Your Critique

**Introduction (3-4 sentences):**
- Briefly restate argument's conclusion
- Summarize main evidence/reasoning
- State that argument has flaws
- Preview your main criticisms (optional)

**Example Introduction:**
"The argument concludes that building a new highway will reduce traffic congestion in the city. This conclusion relies on traffic data, growth projections, and examples from other cities. However, the argument rests on several questionable assumptions and fails to consider critical evidence that would be necessary to properly evaluate the recommendation."

**Body Paragraphs (5-7 sentences each):**

**Option 1: Organize by Assumption**
- Each paragraph examines one major assumption
- Explain the assumption
- Explain why it might not hold
- Discuss what evidence would help

**Option 2: Organize by Type of Flaw**
- Paragraph 1: Problems with evidence
- Paragraph 2: Questionable assumptions
- Paragraph 3: Alternative explanations

**Option 3: Organize by Questions**
- Each paragraph addresses a critical question
- Questions that must be answered to evaluate argument

**Body Paragraph Structure:**
1. Topic sentence (identify flaw/assumption)
2. Explain the flaw
3. Explain why it's problematic
4. Provide specific example or scenario
5. Suggest what evidence would help
6. Link to overall argument strength

**Example Body Paragraph:**
"First, the argument assumes that the survey accurately represents all residents' views, but this assumption is questionable. The survey method is not described, raising concerns about response bias—those with strong opinions about parking may be more likely to respond. Additionally, the survey doesn't indicate whether respondents would actually use a parking garage or prefer other solutions like improved public transportation. To better evaluate this assumption, we would need to know how the survey was conducted, what the response rate was, and whether respondents were asked about alternative solutions."

**Conclusion (3-4 sentences):**
- Summarize main weaknesses
- Restate that argument is flawed as presented
- Note how it could be strengthened
- Avoid introducing new criticisms

**Example Conclusion:**
"In conclusion, while the argument for building a parking garage may have merit, it relies on several unsubstantiated assumptions about survey validity, cost-effectiveness, and lack of alternatives. To strengthen the argument, the city would need to provide evidence that the survey was methodologically sound, demonstrate that a garage is financially viable, and show that other solutions have been considered and rejected for sound reasons. Without such evidence, the recommendation remains inadequately supported."

## Suggesting Alternative Explanations

**Why Alternative Explanations Matter:**
- Show critical thinking
- Demonstrate argument doesn't prove its conclusion
- Highlight missing information
- Strengthen your critique

**How to Develop Alternatives:**
- Ask: "What else could explain this evidence?"
- Consider multiple factors
- Think about what author ignored
- Be specific and plausible

**Example:**

**Argument:** "Our sales increased 20% after we redesigned our website. Therefore, the redesign caused the increase."

**Alternative Explanations:**
- Seasonal trends (holiday shopping)
- Economic improvement
- Competitor went out of business
- Successful advertising campaign happening simultaneously
- General industry growth
- Price reduction during same period

**Presenting Alternatives:**
"The argument assumes the website redesign caused increased sales. However, several alternative explanations could account for this growth. For instance, if the redesign occurred during the holiday season, increased sales might simply reflect seasonal shopping patterns. Similarly, a concurrent advertising campaign or price promotion could explain the uptick. Without evidence ruling out these alternatives, the causal connection between the redesign and sales increase remains unproven."

## Discussing Implications and Consequences

**Consider:**

**Unintended Consequences:**
- What negative effects might occur?
- Who might be harmed?
- What trade-offs exist?

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Is the recommendation practical?
- What resources are required?
- What obstacles might arise?

**Long-term vs Short-term:**
- Will benefits persist?
- Could initial success fade?
- What about future conditions?

**Example:**

**Argument:** "To improve employee productivity, the company should implement a work-from-home policy."

**Implications to Consider:**
- May reduce collaboration and communication
- Could disadvantage employees without suitable home workspaces
- Might decrease company culture and loyalty
- May be infeasible for certain roles
- Could create management challenges
- Might affect client relationships

**In Your Essay:**
"Furthermore, even if working from home increases individual productivity, the argument fails to consider potential negative consequences. Remote work might reduce collaborative innovation, as spontaneous interactions often spark creative solutions. Additionally, the policy could create inequality among employees, benefiting those with dedicated home office space while disadvantaging those in small apartments or with family obligations. The argument would be stronger if it addressed how the company would maintain team cohesion and ensure equitable working conditions for all employees."

## Writing Clear and Precise Analyses

**Be Specific:**
- ✗ "The evidence is weak."
- ✓ "The survey of only 100 residents from one neighborhood cannot represent the entire city's population of 500,000."

**Explain the Problem:**
- ✗ "This is a false cause fallacy."
- ✓ "The argument assumes the new policy caused the improvement, but other factors like economic recovery or seasonal variations could equally explain the change."

**Connect to Conclusion:**
- Always explain HOW the flaw weakens the argument
- Show what difference it makes
- Explain why it matters

**Use Conditional Language:**
- "If X is true, then..."
- "Assuming that..."
- "Provided that..."
- "In the absence of evidence that..."

**Transitional Phrases:**
- "First," "Second," "Additionally," "Furthermore"
- "However," "Nevertheless," "In contrast"
- "For example," "Specifically," "In particular"
- "Consequently," "As a result," "Therefore"
- "Without such evidence," "To evaluate this claim"

**Avoid:**
- Agreeing or disagreeing with conclusion
- Injecting your opinion on the topic
- Introducing irrelevant information
- Being too harsh or dismissive
- Assuming bad faith by the author

**Maintain Objective Tone:**
- ✗ "This argument is ridiculous and the author is clearly wrong."
- ✓ "This argument relies on several questionable assumptions that undermine its persuasiveness."

## Sample Arguments and Model Responses

**Sample Argument 1:**

"The following appeared in a memo from the director of a large group of hospitals:

'In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of UltraClean produced a 40 percent greater reduction in the bacteria population than did the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. During a subsequent test of UltraClean at our hospital in Workby, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group. Therefore, to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply UltraClean at all hand-washing stations throughout our hospital system.'"

**Model Analysis:**

**Introduction:**
The director argues that all hospitals in the group should use UltraClean soap to prevent patient infections. This recommendation is based on laboratory results showing UltraClean's superior bacteria-killing ability and a correlation between UltraClean use at one hospital and reduced infection rates. However, the argument makes several questionable assumptions and lacks critical evidence needed to support this conclusion.

**Body Paragraph 1:**
First, the argument assumes that laboratory conditions accurately predict real-world effectiveness. The study used a "concentrated solution" of UltraClean, but the argument doesn't indicate whether the actual hand soap would be used at this concentration in hospitals. Even if it were, laboratory conditions differ significantly from actual hospital use, where factors like water temperature, washing duration, and proper technique affect outcomes. To strengthen this point, evidence would be needed showing that UltraClean performs better than current soaps under typical hospital conditions, not just in controlled laboratory settings.

**Body Paragraph 2:**
Additionally, the argument commits a false cause fallacy by attributing Workby hospital's lower infection rates solely to UltraClean use. Many factors influence infection rates, including hospital cleanliness protocols, patient population characteristics, types of procedures performed, and staff training. Workby might have lower infection rates because it treats less risky patients, has newer facilities, or maintains superior overall hygiene practices. Without evidence ruling out these alternative explanations—such as data showing infection rates before and after UltraClean implementation, or controlling for other variables—the causal connection remains speculative.

**Body Paragraph 3:**
Furthermore, the argument assumes that what worked at one hospital will work throughout the hospital system. Hospitals in the group may differ in patient demographics, types of care provided, existing infection rates, and staff compliance with hygiene protocols. If Workby specializes in low-risk outpatient procedures while other hospitals handle complex surgeries and immunocompromised patients, UltraClean's effectiveness might not transfer. Information about the comparability of hospitals in the system and baseline infection rates at each facility would help evaluate whether Workby's experience is generalizable.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, while the argument presents some evidence for UltraClean's potential, it relies on unsupported assumptions about laboratory-to-real-world effectiveness, causation, and generalizability. To make a convincing case, the director would need to provide controlled studies in actual hospital settings, demonstrate that infection rate differences cannot be explained by other factors, and show that implementation across diverse hospitals would yield similar results. Without such evidence, the recommendation to switch all hospitals to UltraClean is not adequately justified.

**Sample Argument 2:**

"The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Balmer Island Gazette:

'The population on Balmer Island doubles during the summer months. During the summer, the town council of Balmer Island must hire additional police since there are many more burglaries during the summer than during the winter. The town council of Balmer Island should decrease police funding during the winter when the population is smaller.'"

**Key Flaws to Identify:**
1. **Assumption about burglary patterns**: More burglaries in summer doesn't necessarily mean winter needs less police
2. **False assumption about police work**: Police do more than respond to burglaries
3. **Timing assumption**: When are police hired? Year-round or seasonally?
4. **Cause of burglaries**: Is it population or other factors (tourists' vacation homes unattended, etc.)?
5. **Alternative explanations**: Maybe burglaries are summer tourists' empty homes being robbed
6. **Other crime types**: What about other crimes in winter?
7. **Practical implications**: Can you really hire/fire seasonal police easily?

**Key Questions to Raise:**
- What types of police duties are needed in winter?
- Are current police already seasonal, or year-round?
- What percentage of police work involves burglary response?
- Would reducing funding compromise public safety in other ways?
- Is it cost-effective to hire/release officers seasonally?
