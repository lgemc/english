## Pecha Kucha

I am going to divide the whole presentation in 18 parts:

1. Global challenges 
2. Word is changing 
3. Amount of information
4. The best time to be alive, but
5. World class habilities

Right now we are facing a lot off challenge in an era where anything appears to be faster, longer and higher than never.

must be the most important thing in order to know how to handle this for ever changing world without lose control or be out of the

probably the will be good at school to.
