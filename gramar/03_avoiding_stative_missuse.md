# verb categorization: stative and dynamic

Some verbs can't be used in continuous tenses,
for example: love, know, like, understand, etc

So they can not be used as:
~~I am liking you~~
~~I have been knowing him since high school~~

But dynamic verbs can be used in this cases:

I have been thinking about you since last year.
